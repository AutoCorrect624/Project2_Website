			<p>Our goal is simple, to make food the fresh way. Freshido first started as a simple idea between two friends. 
			We asked ourselves why does fast food have to be unanimous with unhealthy food? Why can't fast food also be healthy? 
			With these two questions in our minds, we set off on a journey to find the answer and inspiration that can bring our idea to life. 
			We've tasted food from all over the world and decided that we want to create a cuisine that is not only healthy, but also flavorful. 
			After many trials and errors, we have finally created a menu that will appeal to both your appetite and health without breaking the bank!</p>
			
			<p>We serve a wide assortment of freshly prepared raw fish and cater to those who care about the environment. 
			We believe food should be sustainable for generations to enjoy. 
			Therefore, our ingredients are all sourced locally to guarantee its freshness and sustainability.</p>
